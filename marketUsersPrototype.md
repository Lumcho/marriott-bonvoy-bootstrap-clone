# Market, Users, Prototype

## Understand Your Market
*Provide links to the 3 websites you explored* 
https://www.realtor.com/rentals

*Briefly explain why these websites are a relevant comparison* 
These websites are fairly known and popular to many people. They all provide some sort of option to find a home, find a rental, or even to sell or list your own property on their website. They also have a similar webpage/layout to what Marriott Homes and Villas is looking for.

- A user can look up homes using address, neighborhood, zip code, school, and or city.
- A user can search homes by price and even change the min and max to the range they want.

## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*

The user research suggests that many people do know what kind of vacation they want, whether it is by activity or location but have a pretty difficult time finding the perfect place for the trip. The Marriott website provides many locations for users to pick and choose but requires a lot of clicks and extra time to browse through each one. One exmaple was when the lady said she didn't want to click 8 times just to see each locations but would've preferred a popup or some sort of hover over option to get more information about a place. Users typically want a fast and easy experience when purchasing or browsing online, the quicker and easier it is for them to do something, the more likely they'll spend money.

A added a feature where you can click on the map and it'll bring up a bigger version of the map where you can still interact and click on the pins on the map.

Also added interactable features where you can click on the given choice and it'll bring you the the page and back. I added detailed instructions on my prototype and interactable features so it feels almost like a real webpage.
